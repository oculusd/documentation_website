          <p>
            OculusD.com, Inc. is a company that provide a platform, services and applications aimed at the 
            <u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things">IoT</a></u> and 
            <u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things#Manufacturing">IIoT</a></u>
            markets. In essence, this means that any "thing" connected to the Internet could use OculusD to log sensor 
            data. At a later stage, the data can be queried, analysed and processed in ways that will help you 
            understand or monitor your environment and perhaps even learn something new!
          </p>
          <p>
            The overall solution consists of three parts:
            <ul>
              <li>Platform - A cloud based platform where all data is aggregated</li>
              <li>Services - Additional value add services that will be provided by OculusD to query and analyse your data.</li>
              <li>Applications - The software applications (and libraries) you will need to integrate your IoT/IIoT things with OculusD</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </section>
        
        <section class="js-section">
          <h3 class="section__title">Where does what fit in</h3>
          <p>
            <img src="images/doc_intro_usage.png">
          </p>
          <p>
            The cloud platform is where all the RESTFul API end-points are you need to integrate to. It is depicted in 
            the diagram as the "OculusD Service".
          </p>
          <p>
            Under most circumstances, you will manage your account(s) and things from a Workstation. This is a computer 
            you typically have full access to and can trust as this is where your credentials and profiles will be saved 
            within your environment (don't worry - if you loose anything, it can be re-created from data in the cloud!).
          </p>
          <p>
            On the workstation, you will typically install several tools:
            <ul>
              <li><u><a href="https://github.com/oculusd/odc_pycommons">odc_pycommons</a></u> - The common Python libraries used by all Python based applications integrating to OculusD</li>
              <li>odc_pyadminlibs - The Python libraries required to perform administrative tasks</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            From the Workstation, you will also export specific configurations to be installed and/or used on your 
            "things".
          </p>
          <p>
            On your "thing" (a <u><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a></u> in this example, with a <u><a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/tmp006-temperature-sensor-python-library/overview">TMP006 Temperature Sensor</a></u>), additional libraries and 
            applications will be required to collect and send data to the OculusD Service.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the thing, you will typically install the following tools (based on the example in the image):
            <ul>
              <li><u><a href="https://github.com/oculusd/odc_pycommons">odc_pycommons</a></u> - The common Python libraries used by all Python based applications integrating to OculusD</li>
              <li>odapp_pysysmon - Python based system monitoring (CPU, Memory, Storage and various on board sensors</li>
              <li>odapp_pysensors - Python based application that uses the configuration generated from the Workstation, with potentially additional libraries, to collect data from sensors and send the data to OculusD</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
