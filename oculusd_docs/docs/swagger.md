# Direct API Integration

Since our own library updates tend to lag slightly behind API updates, we also publish a Swagger UI as well as the [OpenAPI 3.0.0](https://swagger.io/specification/).

You have the following options to explore the Swagger UI:

1. The Swagger UI as deployed with our service [available here](https://data-us1.oculusd.com/v2/ui/)
2. The YAML definition is also [available on GitHub](https://github.com/oculusd/openapi-definitions)
